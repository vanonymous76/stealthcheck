StealthCheck user manual to check for stealthiness of an attack
StealthCheck tests the steathiness of attacks based on logs of all the participants
as well as individual log e.g. while testing attack on Needham- Shroedher Public
Key protocol with two participants, the tool will generate three output Tamarin
files, one each using logs of I and R and third using combined logs of I and R.


Rules for TAMARINfi le to be processed : 
Tamarin model of protocol being verified for stealthiness must adhere to the following naming conventions
for the rules/facts/action labels :

       **Prefix logs to the action labels of all the rules with pattern : LogRuleName(Pars(RuleName)),.....with parameters to be logged as required.
       **Rulename is usually a string of the form ID (a letter) followed by SEQ (a number), where ID is for identifying participant ID uniformly used in model such as I, R, A, B etc. For all the non-participant rules such as secrecy claims etc. 'X' can be used in place of ID. Seq denotes order of rule in the rule list.
       **All protocol rules must be numbered 1,2,3,..,n and placed in a sequence in Tamarin file. This is to help the tool differentiate between protocol rules and auxiliary rules
       **All the logs must have distinct names.
       **Fact and action label names must also be distinct.
       **Comments should be avoided within the rules. If required, must be made either before the start of the rule or after the rule ends.
       **'sid' must not be used by any rule in the Tamarin source. If present, rename 'sid' to avoid confusion.
       **None of the security lemmas should use any of the logs added above.

StealthCheck features :
The python based StealthCheck utility stealthcheck.py modifies the TAMARIN source by :
      ** Adding session IDs
      ** Adding Stealth Logs in rules, if not present, with no parameters.
      ** Updating stealth logs with Session IDs
      ** Adding stealthiness restrictions
and automatically verifies the stealthiness of an attack by verifying / falsifying the security lemmas present in the model.


Usage : 
Execute Tamarin to check presence of any attack on the protocol. Execute ./stcheck single file with this Tamarin source file name or ./stcheck directory
with a directory name containing multiple such Tamarin source le names.
e.g., to check one protocol, execute
     $ ./stcheck singlefile NamesMessages/densac sym cbc.spthy
and, to check all protocols in a single directory, execute
     $ ./stcheck directory NamesMessages
